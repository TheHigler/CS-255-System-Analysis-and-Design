# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass is a customer that wants to provide driving learning materials and driving lessons to students to better prepare them for their driving test. They want a web based application where students can login, take practice exams, read and download study materials, and schedule in person driving tests with an instructor. 

What did you do particularly well?

I feel I wrote the business requirements document quite well, relaying what the customer ultimately wanted, parsing out the different functional and non functional requiremnts that would allow the project to be successful. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I feel I could have constructed my UML diagrams better. Specifically the Use Case Diagram. I think I could have added more functionality and reworded the use cases better to truncate the information I have in there now to make room for more of the systems functionalities. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The shining piece here was a well thoght out and informative business requirements document. This document gives us the opportunity to take informatoin from an interview and lay out all the important pieces. Which also gives us an opportunity to ask the customer more questions if necessary. A well written business requirments document is paramount to creating informative and effective system designs. A user is going to want what they're paying for. So, paying close attention to what they want and keeping them in Earth's atmosphere with their wants and needs will generate a successful product both the customer and the user's will enjoy. You won't maintain user's with a bad product. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I will ask a lot of questions. Likely too much at first. Having a good understanding of what the customer wants to see with their product will allow me to bring to life their vision. In the same vein, I would keep open communication with the customer. I will also put a lot of effort into system designs to ensure they're always getting better and stay informative.
